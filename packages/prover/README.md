- üì° **HTTP Communication**: Fetches status and configuration from the proxy server
- üîó **Hedera Integration**: Submits encrypted messages to Hedera Consensus Service
- ‚úÖ **Route Signing**: Signs routing URLs using Ethereum-compatible signatures

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Or install from the workspace root
npm install --workspace=packages/prover
```

## Dependencies

This package depends on:

- **@hiero-json-rpc-relay/common**: ^1.0.0 - Shared utilities package providing:
  - RSA encryption and ECDSA signature verification
  - Environment variable loading with validation
  - Route signature validation for ensuring data integrity
  - Hedera client initialization and utility functions
- **@hashgraph/sdk**: ^2.66.0 - Official Hedera SDK for blockchain integration
- **ethers**: ^6.14.3 - Ethereum library for ECDSA signing and address derivation

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the prover package directory:

```bash
# Proxy Server Configuration
PROVER_PROXY_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Prover Hedera Consensus Service Configuration
PROVER_HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.1545
PROVER_HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY=0x48b52aba58f4b8dd4cd0e527e28b0eb5f89e2540785b6fcd3c418cc16b640569
PROVER_HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet
PROVER_HEDERA_KEY_TYPE=ECDSA

# Optional: Specific topic ID (overrides proxy's topic)
PROVER_HEDERA_TOPIC_ID=0.0.1234567
```

## HIP-991 Paid Topic Integration

The prover automatically handles **HIP-991 paid topic** submissions with built-in fee management and balance checking.

### Economic Requirements

- **Submission Fee**: 0.5 HBAR per route registration message
- **Account Balance**: Minimum 1 HBAR recommended (covers submission + network fees)
- **Fee Buffer**: Additional balance recommended for network fee variations
- **Automatic Payment**: Fees are deducted automatically during message submission

### Fee Handling

The prover implements robust fee management:

```bash
# Account balance check before submission
üí∞ Account balance: 5.0 HBAR
üì§ Submitting message to HIP-991 topic 0.0.1234567...
üí∞ Prover paid custom fee for HIP-991 topic (max: 0.6 HBAR)
‚úÖ Message submitted successfully
```

### Configuration for Paid Topics

```bash
# Minimum recommended balance for reliable operation
PROVER_HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.1545
PROVER_HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY=0x48b52aba58f4b8dd4cd0e527e28b0eb5f89e2540785b6fcd3c418cc16b640569

# Ensure account has sufficient balance
# - Topic submission: 0.5 HBAR
# - Network fees: ~0.1 HBAR
# - Buffer for variations: 0.4+ HBAR
# Recommended minimum: 1.0 HBAR
```

### Economic Benefits for Provers

1. **Quality Network**: 0.5 HBAR fee ensures serious network participants
2. **Spam-Free Environment**: Economic barrier prevents frivolous registrations
3. **Fair Access**: No gatekeeping - transparent fee structure for all
4. **Predictable Costs**: Fixed 0.5 HBAR fee regardless of network congestion
5. **Investment Protection**: Fees support network infrastructure and stability

## Usage

```bash
# From the prover directory
npm start

# From the workspace root
npm run prover
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Unit tests
npm test

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## How It Works

### Topic ID Resolution Strategy

The prover uses a intelligent topic resolution strategy to maximize compatibility:

1. **Configured Topic Priority**: If `PROVER_HEDERA_TOPIC_ID` (or `PROVER_HEDERA_TOPIC_ID`) is set:

   - Uses the configured topic ID instead of the proxy's topic
   - Fetches only the RSA public key from the proxy's `/status` endpoint
   - Logs which topic is being used vs. which topic the proxy advertises
   - If the proxy is unreachable, fails immediately (public key required for encryption)

2. **Fallback to Proxy Topic**: If no topic is configured:
   - Fetches complete status from proxy including topic ID and public key
   - Uses the proxy's topic ID and all other settings from the status response
   - Traditional behavior for maximum compatibility

### Topic ID Configuration

The prover supports flexible topic ID configuration with automatic fallback:

#### Option 1: Use Configured Topic ID (Recommended)

```bash
# .env file
PROVER_HEDERA_TOPIC_ID=0.0.9999999
```

**Behavior:**

- Prover uses the specified topic ID regardless of what the proxy advertises
- Still fetches the RSA public key from the proxy's `/status` endpoint
- Logs both the configured topic ID and the proxy's topic ID for transparency
- Fails immediately if proxy is unreachable (public key required for encryption)

**Use Cases:**

- Testing with a specific topic
- Using a different topic than the proxy's default
- Ensuring consistent topic usage across multiple prover instances

#### Option 2: Auto-Discovery from Proxy (Default)

```bash
# .env file (PROVER_HEDERA_TOPIC_ID not set)
```

**Behavior:**

- Fetches complete status from proxy including topic ID and public key
- Uses whatever topic the proxy is configured to use
- Traditional behavior for maximum compatibility
- Requires proxy to be reachable to determine topic

**Use Cases:**

- Production environments where proxy manages topic selection
- Simple setup without topic-specific requirements
- Dynamic topic assignment scenarios

#### Logging Examples

**With Configured Topic:**

```text
1Ô∏è‚É£  Using configured topic ID, fetching status for public key...
   üìã Configured Topic ID: 0.0.9999999
‚úÖ Successfully retrieved status with configured topic override
   üîë Public Key: -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0B...
   üìã Using Topic ID: 0.0.9999999 (configured)
   üìã Proxy Topic ID: 0.0.1111111 (ignored)
   üåê Network: testnet
```

**Without Configured Topic:**

```text
1Ô∏è‚É£  No configured topic ID - fetching status from proxy server...
üìä Status received:
   üìã Topic ID: 0.0.1111111
   üåê Network: testnet
   üîë Has Public Key: true
```

**Error Scenarios:**

```text
‚ö†Ô∏è  Failed to get status with configured topic (Connection refused)
   üì° This means the proxy server is not reachable
‚ùå Cannot reach proxy server to get public key: Connection refused
```

### Detailed Workflow

1. **Topic ID Resolution**: Determines which topic to use (configured vs. proxy)
2. **Fetch Proxy Status**: Gets RSA public key (and optionally topic info) from proxy
3. **Create Payload**: Generates a test payload with route signatures using the new format
4. **Sign Routes**: Uses ECDSA to sign concatenated `addr+proofType+nonce+url` for authentication
5. **Encrypt Payload**: Encrypts the JSON payload using the proxy's RSA public key
6. **Submit to Hedera**: Sends the encrypted message to the specified Hedera topic (pays 0.5 HBAR fee)
7. **Start Challenge Server**: Starts HTTP server to respond to URL reachability challenges and receive confirmation
8. **Handle Challenges**: Responds to challenge-response verification requests from proxy
9. **Receive Confirmation**: Waits for confirmation message from proxy when verification is complete
10. **Save Results**: Saves comprehensive session results to a JSON file
11. **Exit Gracefully**: Automatically exits when confirmation is received from proxy

## Results and Logging

The prover automatically saves detailed results to a JSON file in the `data/` directory when the flow completes. The results include:

- **Session Information**: Start/end times, duration, status, proxy URL, Hedera network
- **Payload Details**: Route information, original/encrypted sizes
- **Hedera Submission**: Success status, sequence number, errors
- **Challenge Processing**: Server status, received challenges, success/failure counts
- **Error Log**: Detailed error information throughout the process

Example results file: `data/prover-results-2025-06-09T23-42-15-745Z.json`

## Completion Detection

The prover uses direct confirmation from the proxy:

- **Challenge Responses**: Responds to challenges from the proxy for each route
- **Direct Confirmation**: Waits for confirmation message from proxy to `/confirmation` endpoint
- **Timeout Protection**: Maximum 5-minute execution time to prevent indefinite hanging
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handles SIGINT (Ctrl+C) for manual termination
- **Automatic Exit**: Exits automatically when confirmation is received from proxy

### Payload Format

The prover now uses a new array-based routes format with contract ownership verification for both CREATE and CREATE2 deployments:

**CREATE deployment example:**

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "addr": "0x3ed660420aa9bc674e8f80f744f8062603da385e",
      "proofType": "create",
      "nonce": 33,
      "url": "http://localhost:7546",
      "sig": "0x1234567890abcdef..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**CREATE2 deployment example:**

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "addr": "0x8ba1f109551bd432803012645hac136c5edf4aef",
      "proofType": "create2",
      "salt": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001",
      "initCodeHash": "0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef",
      "url": "http://localhost:7546",
      "sig": "0x9876543210fedcba..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Field descriptions:**

- `addr`: Contract address that should route to the URL
- `proofType`: Type of contract deployment proof (`create` or `create2`)
- `nonce`: Deployment nonce used for CREATE address computation
- `salt`: 32-byte salt used for CREATE2 address computation
- `initCodeHash`: 32-byte hash of the init code used for CREATE2 address computation
- `url`: JSON-RPC endpoint URL for this address
- `sig`: ECDSA signature of concatenated fields (see below)

**Signature format:**

- **CREATE**: Signs `addr+proofType+nonce+url`
- **CREATE2**: Signs `addr+proofType+salt+url`

The signature verification ensures that only the deployer of the contract at `addr` can register routes for it.

## Example Output

## API Reference

### HederaManager

The prover includes its own HederaManager implementation optimized for sending messages:

```javascript
const { HederaManager } } = require('./src/hederaManager');

const manager = new HederaManager({
  accountId: '0.0.1545',
  privateKey: '0x...',
  network: 'testnet',
  keyType: 'ECDSA',
});

// Initialize for a specific topic
await manager.configureTopicForProver('0.0.1234567');

// Submit encrypted message
const receipt = await manager.submitMessageToTopic(topicId, encryptedData);
```

## Error Handling

The prover handles various error scenarios:

- **Proxy Unavailable**: Graceful exit if proxy server is not running
- **Missing Credentials**: Clear error messages for missing Hedera configuration
- **Network Issues**: Timeout handling and retry logic
- **Encryption Failures**: Validation of public key format and encryption process
